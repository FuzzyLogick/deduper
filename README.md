# deduper


A small Bash script I wrote a while back to remove multiple entries in a text file. This was orginally used to remove duplicates 
from password lists used for brute forcing, but it can be used for any text file. 


Just run this silly little batch file like you would any silly batch file.  Then when prompted, enter the name of the file you 
wish to dedupe.  You will get an output file called Deduped.txt that no longer contains duplicates.
